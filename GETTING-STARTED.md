# Laravel

If you're completing the challenge in Laravel, we recommend that you begin with a new [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail) application.

You will need the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. Then follow run the following commands:

```
curl -s "https://laravel.build/news-app" | bash
```

```
cd news-app
 
./vendor/bin/sail up
```
